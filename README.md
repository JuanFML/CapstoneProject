Capstone Page 

### Week 0 5/27
I talked with people about the ideas I already have and to try to generate new ideas from problems the may have.

### Week 1 06/03
Kept elaborating the ideas and looked for new ones

### Week 2 06/10
Decided on which idea to elaborate my capstone project on. Talked with the school involved and made an appointment with the phsycologist and principal. 

### Week 3 06/17
Met with the phsycologist, wrote down a list of features/requirements. Developed a list of technologies which are going to be used throughout the project for different functionalities.

### Week 4 06/24
Started to write the design document, with the functionalities and features already stablished helped me to start the document.

### Week 5 07/1 
Did not advanced much, I read documentation on React and Next JS to get a refresh on JS. Decided on using Material UI instead of Boostrap. Looked onto how to develop the backend using Node, the options I was looking into were Express and NestJS. Decided on using NestJS as it has features that make it cleaner looking and has a good integration with TypeScript.

### Week 6 07/8 
Created the skeleton of the database with the help of NestJS commands, I am taking a course called NestJS: Zero to Hero (Recommend it if you want to learn about NestJS) to help with the basics of the framework, and I've been following that to create the CRUD operations.

### Week 7 07/15
Finish working on the first draft of the design document, while writing I noticed some things that may end up being redudant within the features, although I will bring it up on my next meeting with the school. 

### Week 8 07/22
I am working on the database, finishing the basic CRUD operations of the different tables needed for the database, I also created the database and make a connection with it. I still need look onto how I will have an instance on the cloud running the database and the backend (maybe AWS?).
